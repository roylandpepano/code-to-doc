# Code to Document and PDF Converter

This script is designed to convert source code files into a Microsoft Word (.docx) document and a PDF file. It is particularly useful for authors working on a thesis manuscript who want to include code samples within their document. By automating the conversion process, it saves time and effort in manually copying and formatting code snippets.
## Features

- Converts source code of a project into a well-formatted Microsoft Word document and a PDF file.
- Facilitates the selection of code sections to be included in the thesis manuscript.
- Accelerates the process of integrating code samples into the manuscript.

## How to Use

- Runtime Measurement: The runtime of the program is measured to provide an idea of its execution time.
- Folder Path Input: The user is prompted to enter the filepath of the folder containing the source code files.
- Document Creation: The script creates a new Microsoft Word document and sets the column layout to two columns.
- Code Inclusion: It traverses through the specified folder and its subdirectories, opening each source code file. The code content is then transferred to the Word document.
- Header Formatting: For each code file, a header is added to indicate the file's name. This header is stylized with Arial font, size 10, bold, italic, and underlined.
- Code Formatting: The code lines are added to the document with a consistent format. Each line is styled with Arial font, size 9.
- Saving Documents: The script saves the generated Word document with the same name as the input folder but with a ".docx" extension. It also converts the Word document to a PDF file for quicker viewing and reference.
- Completion Message: Once the conversion process is complete, the script prints a success message along with the filenames of the generated .docx and .pdf files.
- Program Runtime: The total runtime of the program is displayed at the end, indicating how long the conversion process took.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
    - os: For interacting with the operating system and handling file paths.
    - docx: For creating and formatting Microsoft Word documents.
    - time: For measuring program execution time.
    - docx2pdf: For converting the Word document to PDF format.
## Instructions

- Install the required Python packages if they are not already installed:

```bash
  pip install python-docx docx2pdf
```

- Run the script using a Python interpreter:
```bash
  python main.py
```

- Follow the prompts to enter the filepath of the folder containing the source code.
- The script will generate a .docx file and a .pdf file with the same name as the input folder.
